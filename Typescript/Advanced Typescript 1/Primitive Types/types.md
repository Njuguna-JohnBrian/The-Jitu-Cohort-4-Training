# Typescript recognizes Javasscript's built-in "primitive" data types:

- boolean
- number
- null 
- string 
- undefined

- One of the first things that you will discover with TS is that when we declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type.  ie __type inference__

__type inference__ : everywhere in your program TS expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at declaration.
