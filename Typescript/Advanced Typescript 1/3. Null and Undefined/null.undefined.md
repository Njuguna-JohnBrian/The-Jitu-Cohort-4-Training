# Null and Undefined

- ``Undefined`` is different from the value ``null``. 
- The ``null`` value means we know that it does not have a value. 
- The value ``undefined`` means that we do not know it's value.

## Undefined

- Undefined is a primitive value that indicates that a value is not assigned.
- Whenevr we do not assign a value to a variable, TS assignes the __undefined__ value to it.

## Null
- Represents the intentional absence of a value
