# VOID

- Represents the return value of function which don't return a value or return statement does not return anything.

- You can use void as the function parameter.
- Void data type can hold only one value ie ``undefined``.This is bacause Javascript returns the value ``undefined`` when the function does not return any value.

- When you know that a function does/will not return any value, then it best to annotate it with ``void``. This will prevent you from accidently returning a value.
